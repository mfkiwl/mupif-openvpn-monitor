# mupif-openvpn-monitor
MuPIF openvpn-monitor is a web based monitor based on Open VPN Monitor for monitoring and management of VPN and MuPIF platform infrastructure.

## Summary

MuPIF openvpn-monitor is a simple python program to generate html that displays the
status of MuPIF platform infrastructure, including status of VPN network, nameserver and all JobManagers. It allows also web based management of platform components. It is based on OpenVPN monitor (https://github.com/furlongm/openvpn-monitor), extended to provide additional info about MuPIF platform infrastructure. It typically runs on the same host as the OpenVPN
server, however it does not necessarily need to.
